# PomodoroTimer
A simple Pomodoro timer; Created using HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript

Hi! 
I created this project as a refresher towards web development.

The user can select the specified number of session, and can change length of short breaks.
For more number of sessions, the user can select longer break durations of 15 or 30 mintues.

Towards the end of working session or break sessions, 
a bell sound is played to remind the user of the ending of sessions or breaks.

*I have used Bootstrap & Jquery to develop the app more quickly.*
